Roughly speaking, a topological manifold is a topological space that locally looks like \(\R^d\) for some fixed \(n \in \N\). For example, 2-sphere is a topological manifold as well as a 2-torus and a pretzel with \(d = 2\) in each case.

\begin{definition}[Topological Manifold]
	A paracompact Hausdorff topological space \((M, \O)\) is called a \emph{d-dimensional (topological) manifold} if for every \(p \in M\) there exists an open neighborhood \(U_p \in \O\) of \(p\) and a homeomorphism \(x: U_p \to x(U_p) \subseteq \R^d\).
\end{definition}
